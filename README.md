# 301EntranceProject by Dina Ayoub

Preparing for the Code 301 Entrance Test:
need to provide the URL and the GitHub repository for an interactive website that you have created by hand, and from scratch, that is live on the internet. By "interactive" we mean that it uses vanilla JavaScript (specifically event listeners) to process and store user input and subsequently display new content to the user. In addition, the user input and new content must remain retrievable/viewable after a screen refresh. Then, you will continue on to complete a series of multiple-choice questions. The test containing your website, source code, and answers to the mult-choice questions will be submitted all at once.
For your reference, a few final (group) project examples from Code 201:

^if they ask for a login, you can enter anything as it is just local storage.
What we're looking for is a solid understanding of the Code 201 material. If you have more advanced tools in your kit, don't use them as part of this project. Stick to the basics of HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and of course, please demonstrate the use of event listeners.
